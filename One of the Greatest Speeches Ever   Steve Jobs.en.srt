1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
today I want to tell you three stories

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,819
from my life that's it no big deal just

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,080
three stories

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,260
[Music]

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,759
the first story

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,540
is about connecting the dots

7
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,400
I dropped out of Reed College after the

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,140
first six months but then stayed around

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,359
as a drop-in for another 18 months or so

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,640
before I really quit

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,000
so why'd I drop out

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,519
it started before I was born

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,399
my biological mother was a young unwed

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,620
graduate student and she decided to put

15
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,540
me up for adoption

16
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,760
she felt very strongly that I should be

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,860
adopted by college graduates so

18
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,780
everything was all set for me to be

19
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,700
adopted at Birth by a lawyer and his

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,960
wife

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,239
except that when I popped out they

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,920
decided at the last minute that they

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,199
really wanted a girl

24
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,180
so my parents who were on a waiting list

25
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,039
got a call in the middle of the night

26
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,539
asking

27
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,420
we've got an unexpected baby boy do you

28
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,099
want him they said of course

29
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,260
my biological mother found out later

30
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,420
that my mother had never graduated from

31
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,460
college and that my father had never

32
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,380
graduated from high school

33
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,840
she refused to sign the final adoption

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,259
papers

35
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,520
that a few months later when my parents

36
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,580
promised that I would go to college

37
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,080
this was the start

38
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,798
in my life

39
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,100
and 17 years later I did go to college

40
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,079
but I naively chose a college that was

41
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,659
almost as expensive as Stanford

42
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,579
and all of my working-class parent

43
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,380
savings were being spent on my college

44
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,640
tuition

45
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,040
after six months I couldn't see the

46
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,500
value in it I had no idea what I wanted

47
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,899
to do with my life and no idea how

48
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:50,399
College was going to help me figure it

49
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,040
out and here I was spending all the

50
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,720
money my parents had saved their entire

51
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,759
life

52
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,460
so I decided to drop out and trust that

53
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,799
it would all work out okay

54
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,719
it was pretty scary at the time but

55
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,460
looking back it was one of the best

56
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,280
decisions I ever made

57
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,020
the minute I dropped out

58
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,360
I could stop taking the required classes

59
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,520
that didn't interest me and begin

60
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,920
dropping in on the ones that looked far

61
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,840
more interesting

62
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,599
it wasn't all romantic I didn't have a

63
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,520
dorm room so I slept on the floor in

64
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,720
friends rooms

65
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,640
I returned Coke bottles for the five

66
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,400
cent deposits to buy food with and I

67
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,019
would walk the seven miles across town

68
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:32,580
every Sunday night

69
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,800
to get one good meal a week at the Hari

70
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,300
Krishna Temple

71
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,860
I loved it

72
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,260
and much of what I stumbled into by

73
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,879
following my curiosity and intuition

74
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,340
turned out to be Priceless later on

75
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,000
let me give you one example

76
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,500
read college at that time offered

77
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,120
perhaps the best calligraphy instruction

78
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,500
in the country

79
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,620
throughout the campus every poster every

80
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,900
label on every drawer was beautifully

81
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,519
hand calligraphed

82
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,440
because I had dropped out and didn't

83
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,780
have to take the normal classes

84
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,940
I decided to take a calligraphy class to

85
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,200
learn how to do this

86
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,480
I learned about serif and Sans serif

87
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,940
typefaces about varying the amount of

88
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,959
space between different letter

89
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,300
combinations about what makes great

90
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,519
typography great

91
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,879
it was beautiful historical artistically

92
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,680
subtle in a way that science can't

93
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,819
capture

94
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,220
and I found it fascinating

95
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,560
none of this had even a hope of any

96
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,860
practical application in my life

97
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,200
ten years later when we were designing

98
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,659
the first Macintosh computer it all came

99
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:39,420
back to me and we designed it all into

100
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,700
the Mac it was the first computer with

101
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,400
beautiful typography if I had never

102
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,379
dropped in on that single course in

103
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:48,360
college the Mac would have never had

104
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,159
multiple typefaces or proportionally

105
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,739
spaced fonts and since Windows just

106
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,900
copied the Mac it's likely that no

107
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,420
personal computer would have them

108
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,879
if I had never dropped out I would have

109
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,379
never dropped in on that calligraphy

110
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,299
class and personal computers might not

111
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:05,099
have the wonderful typography that they

112
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:05,879
do

113
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,980
of course it was impossible to connect

114
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,840
the dots looking forward when I was in

115
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,060
college but it was very very clear

116
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,640
looking backwards 10 years later

117
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,220
again you can't connect the dots looking

118
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,899
forward you can only connect them

119
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,600
looking backwards so you have to trust

120
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,400
that the dots will somehow connect in

121
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,320
your future you have to trust in

122
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,380
something your gut Destiny Life Karma

123
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,340
whatever

124
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,199
because believing that the dots will

125
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,720
connect down the road will give you the

126
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,880
confidence to follow your heart even

127
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,979
when it leads you off the well-worn path

128
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,990
and that will make all the difference

129
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,560
[Music]

130
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,419
my second story

131
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:49,020
is about love and loss

132
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,840
I was lucky I found what I love to do

133
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,900
early in life was and I started Apple in

134
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,300
my parents garage when I was 20. we

135
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,460
worked hard and in 10 years Apple had

136
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,900
grown from Just the Two of Us in a

137
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,060
garage into a two billion dollar company

138
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,639
with over four thousand employees we

139
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,560
just released our finest creation the

140
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,539
Macintosh a year earlier and I just

141
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:11,280
turned 30.

142
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,039
and then I got fired

143
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:16,139
how can you get fired from a company you

144
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,340
started

145
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,699
well as Apple grew we hired someone who

146
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,800
I thought was very talented to run the

147
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,600
company with me and for the first year

148
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,639
or so things went well but then our

149
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,440
visions of the future began to diverge

150
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,139
and eventually we had a falling out when

151
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:33,240
we did our board of directors sided with

152
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,840
him and so at 30 I was out and very

153
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,340
publicly out

154
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,020
what had been the focus of my entire

155
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,060
adult life was gone and it was

156
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,440
devastating

157
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,180
I really didn't know what to do for a

158
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,460
few months I felt that I'd let the

159
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,020
previous generation of entrepreneurs

160
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,419
down that I had dropped the Baton as it

161
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:52,979
was being passed to me

162
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,440
I met with David Packard and Bob Noyes

163
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,960
and tried to apologize for screwing up

164
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,340
so badly

165
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,440
I was a very public failure and I even

166
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,639
thought about running away from the

167
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,479
valley

168
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,600
but something slowly began to dawn on me

169
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,259
I still loved what I did

170
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:11,639
the turn of events at Apple had not

171
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,259
changed that one bit

172
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,660
I'd been rejected but I was still in

173
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,979
love

174
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,919
and so I decided to start over

175
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,600
I didn't see it then

176
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,979
it turned out that getting fired from

177
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:24,300
Apple was the best thing that could have

178
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,919
ever happened to me

179
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,319
the heaviness of being successful was

180
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,300
replaced by the lightness of being a

181
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,979
beginner again less sure about

182
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:33,240
everything

183
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,440
freed me to enter one of the most

184
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,360
creative periods of my life

185
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,220
during the next five years I started a

186
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,560
company named next another company named

187
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,600
Pixar and fell in love with an amazing

188
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,699
woman who would become my wife

189
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,440
Pixar went on to create the world's

190
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,660
first computer animated feature film Toy

191
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,699
Story and is now the most successful

192
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:54,500
Animation Studio in the world

193
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:57,720
in a remarkable turn of events Apple

194
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,479
bought next and I returned to Apple and

195
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,220
the technology we developed it next is

196
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,539
at the heart of Apple's current

197
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:06,539
Renaissance and Lorraine and I have a

198
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,880
wonderful family together

199
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,860
I'm pretty sure none of this would have

200
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,240
happened if I hadn't been fired from

201
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,960
Apple

202
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,240
it was awful tasting medicine but I

203
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,280
guess the patient needed it

204
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,560
sometime life sometimes life's going to

205
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,240
hit you in the head with a brick

206
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,039
don't lose faith

207
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,720
I'm convinced that the only thing that

208
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,580
kept me going was that I loved what I

209
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,759
did you've got to find what you love and

210
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,740
that is as true for work as it is for

211
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,000
your lovers

212
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,919
your work is going to fill a large part

213
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,720
of your life and the only way to be

214
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,639
truly satisfied is to do what you

215
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,039
believe is great work and the only way

216
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,039
to do great work is to love what you do

217
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:46,319
if you haven't found it yet keep looking

218
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,539
and don't settle

219
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,819
as with all matters of the heart you'll

220
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:53,220
know when you find it and like any great

221
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,080
relationship it just gets better and

222
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,720
better as the years roll on so keep

223
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,580
looking don't settle

224
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,080
my third story

225
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,120
is about death

226
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,000
when I was 17 I read a quote that went

227
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,819
something like if you live each day as

228
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:14,039
if it was your last someday you'll most

229
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:16,259
certainly be right

230
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,840
it made an impression on me and since

231
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,660
then for the past 33 years I've looked

232
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,160
in the mirror every morning and asked

233
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,680
myself if today were the last day of my

234
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,020
life what I want to do what I am about

235
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,699
to do today

236
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:31,919
and whenever the answer has been no for

237
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,380
too many days in a row I know I need to

238
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,940
change something

239
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,760
remembering that I'll be dead soon is

240
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,200
the most important tool I've ever

241
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,700
encountered to help me make the big

242
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,440
choices in life

243
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,260
because almost everything all external

244
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,959
expectations all Pride all fear of

245
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,880
embarrassment or failure these things

246
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,040
just fall away in the face of death

247
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,160
leaving only what is truly important

248
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,860
remembering that you are going to die is

249
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,320
the best way I know to avoid the Trap of

250
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,140
thinking you have something to lose you

251
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,019
are already naked there is no reason not

252
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:09,660
to follow your heart

253
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,240
no one wants to die

254
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,100
even people who want to go to heaven

255
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,380
don't want to die to get there

256
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,580
and yet

257
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,220
death is the destination we all share

258
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,100
no one has ever escaped it and that is

259
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,040
as it should be because death is very

260
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,160
likely the single best invention of life

261
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,620
it's life's change agent it clears out

262
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,899
the old to make way for the new

263
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:36,720
right now the new is you

264
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,180
but someday not too long from now you

265
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,100
will gradually become the old and be

266
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,540
cleared away

267
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,180
sorry to be so dramatic but it's quite

268
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,620
true

269
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,620
your time is limited so don't waste it

270
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,019
living someone else's life

271
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:54,360
don't be trapped by Dogma which is

272
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,680
living with the results of other

273
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,180
people's thinking

274
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,220
don't let the noise of others opinions

275
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,800
drowned out your own inner voice and

276
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,720
most important have the courage to

277
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,060
follow your heart and intuition they

278
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,760
somehow already know what you truly want

279
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,779
to become

280
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:13,740
everything else is secondary

281
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,380
stay hungry stay foolish
