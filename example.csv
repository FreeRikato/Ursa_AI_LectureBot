1,"00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280",today I want to tell you three stories
2,"00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,819",from my life that's it no big deal just
3,"00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,080",three stories
4,"00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,260",[Music]
5,"00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,759",the first story
6,"00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,540",is about connecting the dots
7,"00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,400",I dropped out of Reed College after the
8,"00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,140",first six months but then stayed around
9,"00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,359",as a drop-in for another 18 months or so
10,"00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,640",before I really quit
11,"00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,000",so why'd I drop out
12,"00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,519",it started before I was born
13,"00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,399",my biological mother was a young unwed
14,"00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,620",graduate student and she decided to put
15,"00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,540",me up for adoption
16,"00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,760",she felt very strongly that I should be
17,"00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,860",adopted by college graduates so
18,"00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,780",everything was all set for me to be
19,"00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,700",adopted at Birth by a lawyer and his
20,"00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,960",wife
21,"00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,239",except that when I popped out they
22,"00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,920",decided at the last minute that they
23,"00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,199",really wanted a girl
24,"00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,180",so my parents who were on a waiting list
25,"00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,039",got a call in the middle of the night
26,"00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,539",asking
27,"00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,420",we've got an unexpected baby boy do you
28,"00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,099",want him they said of course
29,"00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,260",my biological mother found out later
30,"00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,420",that my mother had never graduated from
31,"00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,460",college and that my father had never
32,"00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,380",graduated from high school
33,"00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,840",she refused to sign the final adoption
34,"00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,259",papers
35,"00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,520",that a few months later when my parents
36,"00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,580",promised that I would go to college
37,"00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,080",this was the start
38,"00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,798",in my life
39,"00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,100",and 17 years later I did go to college
40,"00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,079",but I naively chose a college that was
41,"00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,659",almost as expensive as Stanford
42,"00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,579",and all of my working-class parent
43,"00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,380",savings were being spent on my college
44,"00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,640",tuition
45,"00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,040",after six months I couldn't see the
46,"00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,500",value in it I had no idea what I wanted
47,"00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,899",to do with my life and no idea how
48,"00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:50,399",College was going to help me figure it
49,"00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,040",out and here I was spending all the
50,"00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,720",money my parents had saved their entire
51,"00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,759",life
52,"00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,460",so I decided to drop out and trust that
53,"00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,799",it would all work out okay
54,"00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,719",it was pretty scary at the time but
55,"00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,460",looking back it was one of the best
56,"00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,280",decisions I ever made
57,"00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,020",the minute I dropped out
58,"00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,360",I could stop taking the required classes
59,"00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,520",that didn't interest me and begin
60,"00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,920",dropping in on the ones that looked far
61,"00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,840",more interesting
62,"00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,599",it wasn't all romantic I didn't have a
63,"00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,520",dorm room so I slept on the floor in
64,"00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,720",friends rooms
65,"00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,640",I returned Coke bottles for the five
66,"00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,400",cent deposits to buy food with and I
67,"00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,019",would walk the seven miles across town
68,"00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:32,580",every Sunday night
69,"00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,800",to get one good meal a week at the Hari
70,"00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,300",Krishna Temple
71,"00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,860",I loved it
72,"00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,260",and much of what I stumbled into by
73,"00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,879",following my curiosity and intuition
74,"00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,340",turned out to be Priceless later on
75,"00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,000",let me give you one example
76,"00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,500",read college at that time offered
77,"00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,120",perhaps the best calligraphy instruction
78,"00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,500",in the country
79,"00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,620",throughout the campus every poster every
80,"00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,900",label on every drawer was beautifully
81,"00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,519",hand calligraphed
82,"00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,440",because I had dropped out and didn't
83,"00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,780",have to take the normal classes
84,"00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,940",I decided to take a calligraphy class to
85,"00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,200",learn how to do this
86,"00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,480",I learned about serif and Sans serif
87,"00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,940",typefaces about varying the amount of
88,"00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,959",space between different letter
89,"00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,300",combinations about what makes great
90,"00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,519",typography great
91,"00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,879",it was beautiful historical artistically
92,"00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,680",subtle in a way that science can't
93,"00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,819",capture
94,"00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,220",and I found it fascinating
95,"00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,560",none of this had even a hope of any
96,"00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,860",practical application in my life
97,"00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,200",ten years later when we were designing
98,"00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,659",the first Macintosh computer it all came
99,"00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:39,420",back to me and we designed it all into
100,"00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,700",the Mac it was the first computer with
101,"00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,400",beautiful typography if I had never
102,"00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,379",dropped in on that single course in
103,"00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:48,360",college the Mac would have never had
104,"00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,159",multiple typefaces or proportionally
105,"00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,739",spaced fonts and since Windows just
106,"00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,900",copied the Mac it's likely that no
107,"00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,420",personal computer would have them
108,"00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,879",if I had never dropped out I would have
109,"00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,379",never dropped in on that calligraphy
110,"00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,299",class and personal computers might not
111,"00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:05,099",have the wonderful typography that they
112,"00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:05,879",do
113,"00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,980",of course it was impossible to connect
114,"00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,840",the dots looking forward when I was in
115,"00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,060",college but it was very very clear
116,"00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,640",looking backwards 10 years later
117,"00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,220",again you can't connect the dots looking
118,"00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,899",forward you can only connect them
119,"00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,600",looking backwards so you have to trust
120,"00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,400",that the dots will somehow connect in
121,"00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,320",your future you have to trust in
122,"00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,380",something your gut Destiny Life Karma
123,"00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,340",whatever
124,"00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,199",because believing that the dots will
125,"00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,720",connect down the road will give you the
126,"00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,880",confidence to follow your heart even
127,"00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,979",when it leads you off the well-worn path
128,"00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,990",and that will make all the difference
129,"00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,560",[Music]
130,"00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,419",my second story
131,"00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:49,020",is about love and loss
132,"00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,840",I was lucky I found what I love to do
133,"00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,900",early in life was and I started Apple in
134,"00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,300",my parents garage when I was 20. we
135,"00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,460",worked hard and in 10 years Apple had
136,"00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,900",grown from Just the Two of Us in a
137,"00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,060",garage into a two billion dollar company
138,"00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,639",with over four thousand employees we
139,"00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,560",just released our finest creation the
140,"00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,539",Macintosh a year earlier and I just
141,"00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:11,280",turned 30.
142,"00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,039",and then I got fired
143,"00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:16,139",how can you get fired from a company you
144,"00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,340",started
145,"00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,699",well as Apple grew we hired someone who
146,"00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,800",I thought was very talented to run the
147,"00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,600",company with me and for the first year
148,"00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,639",or so things went well but then our
149,"00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,440",visions of the future began to diverge
150,"00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,139",and eventually we had a falling out when
151,"00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:33,240",we did our board of directors sided with
152,"00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,840",him and so at 30 I was out and very
153,"00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,340",publicly out
154,"00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,020",what had been the focus of my entire
155,"00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,060",adult life was gone and it was
156,"00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,440",devastating
157,"00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,180",I really didn't know what to do for a
158,"00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,460",few months I felt that I'd let the
159,"00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,020",previous generation of entrepreneurs
160,"00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,419",down that I had dropped the Baton as it
161,"00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:52,979",was being passed to me
162,"00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,440",I met with David Packard and Bob Noyes
163,"00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,960",and tried to apologize for screwing up
164,"00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,340",so badly
165,"00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,440",I was a very public failure and I even
166,"00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,639",thought about running away from the
167,"00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,479",valley
168,"00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,600",but something slowly began to dawn on me
169,"00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,259",I still loved what I did
170,"00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:11,639",the turn of events at Apple had not
171,"00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,259",changed that one bit
172,"00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,660",I'd been rejected but I was still in
173,"00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,979",love
174,"00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,919",and so I decided to start over
175,"00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,600",I didn't see it then
176,"00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,979",it turned out that getting fired from
177,"00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:24,300",Apple was the best thing that could have
178,"00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,919",ever happened to me
179,"00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,319",the heaviness of being successful was
180,"00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,300",replaced by the lightness of being a
181,"00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,979",beginner again less sure about
182,"00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:33,240",everything
183,"00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,440",freed me to enter one of the most
184,"00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,360",creative periods of my life
185,"00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,220",during the next five years I started a
186,"00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,560",company named next another company named
187,"00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,600",Pixar and fell in love with an amazing
188,"00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,699",woman who would become my wife
189,"00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,440",Pixar went on to create the world's
190,"00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,660",first computer animated feature film Toy
191,"00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,699",Story and is now the most successful
192,"00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:54,500",Animation Studio in the world
193,"00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:57,720",in a remarkable turn of events Apple
194,"00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,479",bought next and I returned to Apple and
195,"00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,220",the technology we developed it next is
196,"00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,539",at the heart of Apple's current
197,"00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:06,539",Renaissance and Lorraine and I have a
198,"00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,880",wonderful family together
199,"00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,860",I'm pretty sure none of this would have
200,"00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,240",happened if I hadn't been fired from
201,"00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,960",Apple
202,"00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,240",it was awful tasting medicine but I
203,"00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,280",guess the patient needed it
204,"00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,560",sometime life sometimes life's going to
205,"00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,240",hit you in the head with a brick
206,"00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,039",don't lose faith
207,"00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,720",I'm convinced that the only thing that
208,"00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,580",kept me going was that I loved what I
209,"00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,759",did you've got to find what you love and
210,"00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,740",that is as true for work as it is for
211,"00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,000",your lovers
212,"00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,919",your work is going to fill a large part
213,"00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,720",of your life and the only way to be
214,"00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,639",truly satisfied is to do what you
215,"00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,039",believe is great work and the only way
216,"00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,039",to do great work is to love what you do
217,"00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:46,319",if you haven't found it yet keep looking
218,"00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,539",and don't settle
219,"00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,819",as with all matters of the heart you'll
220,"00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:53,220",know when you find it and like any great
221,"00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,080",relationship it just gets better and
222,"00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,720",better as the years roll on so keep
223,"00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,580",looking don't settle
224,"00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,080",my third story
225,"00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,120",is about death
226,"00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,000",when I was 17 I read a quote that went
227,"00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,819",something like if you live each day as
228,"00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:14,039",if it was your last someday you'll most
229,"00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:16,259",certainly be right
230,"00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,840",it made an impression on me and since
231,"00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,660",then for the past 33 years I've looked
232,"00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,160",in the mirror every morning and asked
233,"00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,680",myself if today were the last day of my
234,"00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,020",life what I want to do what I am about
235,"00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,699",to do today
236,"00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:31,919",and whenever the answer has been no for
237,"00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,380",too many days in a row I know I need to
238,"00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,940",change something
239,"00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,760",remembering that I'll be dead soon is
240,"00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,200",the most important tool I've ever
241,"00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,700",encountered to help me make the big
242,"00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,440",choices in life
243,"00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,260",because almost everything all external
244,"00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,959",expectations all Pride all fear of
245,"00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,880",embarrassment or failure these things
246,"00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,040",just fall away in the face of death
247,"00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,160",leaving only what is truly important
248,"00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,860",remembering that you are going to die is
249,"00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,320",the best way I know to avoid the Trap of
250,"00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,140",thinking you have something to lose you
251,"00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,019",are already naked there is no reason not
252,"00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:09,660",to follow your heart
253,"00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,240",no one wants to die
254,"00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,100",even people who want to go to heaven
255,"00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,380",don't want to die to get there
256,"00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,580",and yet
257,"00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,220",death is the destination we all share
258,"00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,100",no one has ever escaped it and that is
259,"00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,040",as it should be because death is very
260,"00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,160",likely the single best invention of life
261,"00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,620",it's life's change agent it clears out
262,"00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,899",the old to make way for the new
263,"00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:36,720",right now the new is you
264,"00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,180",but someday not too long from now you
265,"00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,100",will gradually become the old and be
266,"00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,540",cleared away
267,"00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,180",sorry to be so dramatic but it's quite
268,"00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,620",true
269,"00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,620",your time is limited so don't waste it
270,"00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,019",living someone else's life
271,"00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:54,360",don't be trapped by Dogma which is
272,"00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,680",living with the results of other
273,"00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,180",people's thinking
274,"00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,220",don't let the noise of others opinions
275,"00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,800",drowned out your own inner voice and
276,"00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,720",most important have the courage to
277,"00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,060",follow your heart and intuition they
278,"00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,760",somehow already know what you truly want
279,"00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,779",to become
280,"00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:13,740",everything else is secondary
281,"00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,380",stay hungry stay foolish
