00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
 In today's video, we're going to look at one of my favorite pieces of software, SyncThink.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,000
 SyncThink is a free, open source file syncing solution for Mac, Windows, Linux,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,040
 BSD, Solaris, Android, but sadly not for iOS, and I will talk a little bit about

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,040
 workarounds for iOS later in the video. So the purpose of today's video is to show you how to get

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,080
 up and running this SyncThink, how to install it, how to pair your machines together,

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,760
 how to share files and so on and so forth. But before we dive into the installation steps,

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,760
 I just want to talk about two characteristics of SyncThink that I think make it a really

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,640
 interesting solution for syncing and is the reason why I use it over something like Dropbox or

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,960
 iCloud. So the first characteristic is that SyncThink uses peer-to-peer syncing. What this means

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,960
 is that your machines talk to each other directly and they share files with each other directly.

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,320
 There's no centralized server, which is what you have with iCloud or Dropbox where each machine

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,480
 sends to the central server and then the central server sends on to the rest of machines in your

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,040
 little file sharing network. The benefit of peer-to-peer is that you're not beholden on a central

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,280
 service or a central server or even a central service provider. So if Dropbox decides to shut down

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,480
 their service one day and you use Dropbox for syncing, you are in a mess. Also if Dropbox just

16
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,120
 has an outage, you can't sync your files. You don't get that with peer-to-peer syncing. Even if one

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,440
 machine is not working, the rest of the machines can still talk and obviously because SyncThink is

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,560
 free and open, you are in complete control over your Sync network. So in certain cases, two peers in

19
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,840
 your network can't talk to each other, so they transmit data via a relay and this brings me onto

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,080
 the second characteristic of SyncThink that I real like, which is that the data is end-to-end encrypted.

21
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,720
 It gets encrypted on the client that transmits the data and then decrypted on the client that receives

22
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,720
 it. There's no bit in between where the data is decrypted. Contrast this with solutions like iCloud

23
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,960
 or Dropbox or Google Drive where data is encrypted in transit, so between your machine and the

24
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,920
 central server and it's encrypted at rest or when it's been stored on the central server. But there's

25
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,080
 the small window when the data arrives from transit and before it's written to storage where it's

26
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,360
 actually decrypted. And your mileage may vary on how much of an issue that is and certainly end-to-end

27
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,480
 encryption is something to strive for but it's not absolutely necessary. I feel much more comfortable

28
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,760
 with my data being a network that I completely control touching only my machines and always

29
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,120
 flowing end-to-end encrypted between those machines. One of the very nice things about SyncThink

30
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,720
 though is it's not all on nothing solution. You can still use it alongside your other file syncing

31
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,600
 solutions and we'll see it later on when we look at how to make SyncThink work alongside iOS by

32
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,920
 plugging it into iCloud. For now let's dive straight into installation. So to install a Mac you've

33
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,520
 got two main options you can install using HomeBrew which if you are using that that's a great way to

34
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,720
 install it and I've got a video on that up above. If you're not using HomeBrew and you just want to

35
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,840
 dive straight into SyncThink then come to SyncThink website, come to the downloads page and what you

36
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,800
 want to do is download this SyncThink Mac OS application bundle. This is the easiest and nicest

37
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,960
 way to use SyncThink on the Mac. Click on that to be brought to the downloads page and then download

38
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,960
 this DMG image here. Your version may differ if you're watching this at some point in the future.

39
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:57,360
 Once that downloads come to your download section click on the DMG image to mount it and then drag

40
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,520
 the SyncThink icon into applications. Once that's inside applications if you open up your applications folder

41
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,360
 find the SyncThink icon double click on it, choose Open and you'll see that a little SyncThink

42
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,880
 icon pops up in the top corner here and we'll revisit that shortly when we look at how the control

43
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,120
 panel works. Now let's see how to install on Linux. So on Linux you'll like this to find that

44
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,640
 SyncThink is in your package manager so it's a really easy installation. I'm here on a bug two

45
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,160
 so I'm just going to do a Studio app to install SyncThink. It doesn't take very long to install. Once

46
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,320
 that's installed you now need to start SyncThink and if you're using an operating system that has

47
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:40,000
 system D then you can do Studio, System CTL, Start SyncThink and it failed and the reason for this

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,480
 is SyncThink is not a service that you run just once on your machine you run it once per user so

49
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,400
 instead of running System CTL Start SyncThink use do start and then at the user in question. I'm

50
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,520
 user parallels because I'm running this on my virtual machine so that started that if you want to

51
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,120
 chip where you're using the image you can just run who am I like that until you're in parallels

52
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,200
 and you may also want SyncThink to start when the machine starts so rather than just running start

53
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,080
 here we'll also run enable so this one now also starts SyncThink for my parallel user when the

54
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,280
 machine boots. Okay great let's turn our attention now to Windows. So on Windows come to the

55
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,240
 SyncThink downloads page again and rather than choosing SyncThink Mac OS choose this Sync Traysor

56
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,640
 this is a really nice wrapper around the default SyncThink binary that gives you kind of like a

57
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,640
 tray icon and a file system watch and launch and all that kind of stuff it makes SyncThink feel

58
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:34,640
 much more like a Windows app so click on that scroll down here to the setup XE for your platform

59
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,840
 so you'll want X86 or X64 because I'm using SyncThink on ARM I can't actually use this package I'm

60
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,720
 going to install a different package but download that and install it and then you'll get to

61
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,880
 basically the same situation that I'm in. If you're on ARM what you want to do instead is come down

62
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,000
 to base SyncThink here and choose one of the base Windows packages I'm on ARM 64 and download

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:04,720
 that to open file choose file explorer come in here run SyncThink and it will say that this is

64
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,040
 an application that's in a compressed folder so you can just choose extract all extract them all

65
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,400
 and now run SyncThink again when you first try to run it Windows Defender will complain you

66
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,080
 need to tell it it's absolutely fine so the button here says don't run you actually have to click on

67
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:30,160
 more info and then you can choose run it anyway and then choose allow access and there we go we've

68
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,640
 got SyncThink running now when you run this default Windows package you are running just a SyncThink

69
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,360
 app if you reboot Windows it doesn't restart I will link below some instructions on how you can

70
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,320
 mount this as a Windows service so it will automatically start but if you can if you're on x86

71
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,920
 or x8664 you should try to use Sync Trays or it's a much nicer experience so now we've got three

72
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,240
 machines running SyncThink Windows Ubuntu and Mac now it's time to configure each of those

73
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,760
 machines and actually start to pair them and the way this works inside of SyncThink is you use

74
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,320
 the admin console and the admin console is accessible via the browser and it's on each machine

75
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,160
 it's available at local host colom 8384 the first time you run it we'll ask if you want to allow

76
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,640
 an on-miss reporting I never do and it will also tell you that a username and password has not

77
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,000
 been set for GUI authentication by default you can only access the control panel from the machine

78
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,080
 that SyncThink is installed on so you don't necessarily need a username and password when you're

79
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,440
 in that setup if you choose to make the control panel available to other machines which you can do

80
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,120
 then you should definitely set a username and password however I think there's a nicer solution

81
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,680
 and we'll see that a little bit later so I'm just going to click okay for now and let's make this

82
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,200
 a little bit bigger that's perfect so you can see there's kind of three areas here there's an area

83
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,000
 where folders are so the nice thing about SyncThink is you can pick exactly which folders you want to

84
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,880
 share and exactly which machines it's not like iCloud or Dropbox where you have one big massive folder

85
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,280
 you have to share everything you can pick and choose where you want these files to come from and

86
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,120
 where on the machine you want them to go and we'll see some examples shortly there's a bunch of

87
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,280
 information about the machine itself what the download and not like rate is how much is being shared

88
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,080
 there's this identification token this is really important this is how machines find each other how

89
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,600
 you share one machine with another we'll see some more examples of that soon and then when we have

90
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:19,440
 a remote device it will show up down here up in the top corner here where it says actions you can find

91
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,440
 settings you can restart so on and so forth and then if you come into settings one of the things you

92
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:30,080
 can do in this GUI section here is set a username and password if you do want to enable all the machines

93
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:38,960
 to access this control panel you can take where it says 127001 here and change it to 0000 like that

94
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,440
 i recommend not doing that and we'll see it on turns if very soon so i've got my machine here on

95
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,480
 windows and i want to pair it say with my Ubuntu machine so i'm going to choose ad remote device

96
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,120
 and it's already found those two devices when you have SyncThink running on multiple machines on

97
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,960
 the same network they will automatically see each other so this is a really nice way of pairing

98
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,040
 machines if you can do them all on the same network you kind of just get this helper where machines

99
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,560
 are not on the same network they don't automatically see each other and we'll see an example soon

100
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,920
 of how you can pair machines in that situation i don't know which of these is my Ubuntu machine

101
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,600
 so i'm going to switch back into that and then i'll open the control panel here as well

102
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:23,280
 again local host 8384 let's also make that a little bit nicer to read

103
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,840
 so you can see similar control panel just a different device name and a different identification

104
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,440
 and i can see that the identification for this is as yfz0 so let's come back to windows and we're

105
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,120
 going to pair with that machine as yfz0 and you can see the real IDs much longer but when using

106
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,520
 on the local network they use the short IDs i'm going to press on that i can give it a device name

107
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:53,200
 so i'll say that's my Ubuntu Ubuntu and press save so when you first create it it says

108
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,480
 disconnected unused and that's because you haven't yet paired the machines together you have to

109
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,720
 when pairing machines and also when sharing folders you have to offer it on one side and accept it

110
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,680
 on the other side so we come back to Ubuntu now what we see is that this little pop-up here says

111
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,840
 oh this new device wants to share with you wants to connect with you so i'm going to choose add

112
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,360
 device i can give this a name i'm just going to call it windows

113
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:24,160
 i save so now it says you're connected to windows so now when i can windows it says that my Ubuntu

114
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,240
 is connected but unused and it's unused because we haven't yet shared a folder so let's now share

115
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,280
 some folders now i like to get rid of the default folder so i just come to edit on that and press

116
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:40,320
 remove yes and instead i'll add a custom folder so pressing the add folder button you can give

117
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,600
 it a custom label but we'll change that in a second the most important thing for me is the folder

118
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,480
 path where's the data coming from i don't want this randomly generated one i want a folder from

119
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,160
 actual windows and i want to share my windows documents folder i'm just going to call it documents

120
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,720
 and there are a bunch of other settings that will revisit in a second the most important one for

121
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,600
 me is file versioning but we'll see that soon but you do want to come to sharing and choose which

122
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:10,880
 device are you sharing this folder with so let's share it with Ubuntu press save so that says

123
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,200
 document is up to date here and now if i come back to my Ubuntu machine i'm now prompted do you

124
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:22,640
 want to share the folder documents with the machine windows so click add and it brings up a similar

125
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:28,400
 dialog now i get to choose the values of that documents folder on this machine and i could if i

126
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:33,680
 wanted to put it somewhere completely separate maybe i want to put it under sync like this and have

127
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,360
 it separate from my documents folder but no i'm going to use the default documents folder for now

128
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,840
 press save and i will just quickly clean up the default folder here also so now we've got a

129
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,640
 documents folder here and there's nothing in it so let's put something in it say on the Ubuntu

130
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,600
 side and we'll see it appear on the windows side so to do that i'm just going to bring up my terminal

131
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:00,720
 and i'm going to come into my documents folder let's just say echo hello into a test.txt file

132
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,000
 and i can just check that that is there on this machine

133
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,680
 yeah great and if i come back to the control panel so i have to see some action now what you want

134
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,480
 to see here is that in reskans it gives you the period how often is it going to do a full reskin

135
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:21,040
 of the folder but you most want to see this this little i icon this says that sync thing is watching

136
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,720
 for file changes using your operating systems watch support so it will detect changes far faster

137
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,120
 if you don't see that little i icon with the enabled next to it you need to install some additional

138
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:37,200
 software and i will link below what that software is i find now that most machines have file

139
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,120
 watching enabled by default so you don't really have to do it very often and you can now see that

140
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,080
 the global state and the local state show that there's one file which is sick spites and it also

141
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,160
 shows that my windows device is up to date and it took maybe three or four seconds to find that i

142
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,640
 am not quite sure it usually happens well within 10 seconds to sync the files together if we come

143
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,280
 back to windows we'll see similar data on this side so it's saying that i'm up to date the global

144
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,800
 state and the local state are the same and it also shows you like what was the last thing that

145
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,800
 happened so the latest change is that i updated text dot txt and just to show let's come to the

146
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:16,560
 documents folder we can see test txt here i'm not hoping it was notepad and there it is hello so now

147
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,080
 we've got two machines talking to each other and they're sharing a folder let's add a third machine

148
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,240
 into the mix and i'm going to add my personal Mac into this little syncing network and if you look

149
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,240
 at the control panel from the Mac you can see i've already got a bunch of folders that i've shared

150
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,680
 and i've only got one remote device you might wonder why i'll tell you a little bit about that in

151
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,840
 a second but let's add a second device in come to our remote device i'm going to pick the a bunch

152
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:41,440
 of machine come on one two and before i press say i'm going to come to sharing and i'm going to make

153
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,760
 this the introducer and i want to be introduced to the other devices that the a bunch of machine

154
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:54,320
 knows i also want to auto accept folders that that machine is exposing will still need to go through

155
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,080
 and click a bunch of buttons but we don't have to specifically pair up with every single machine

156
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:03,040
 and every single folder so let's come to save come to the Ubuntu machine you still have to accept

157
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:10,240
 that pairing on this side so press add device which i'll leave the name as it is so now i've accepted

158
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,000
 the pairing on the Ubuntu machine and it says that the machine is unused but connected which is

159
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,080
 exactly right if we go back to the Mac we get the same thing it's connected but unused and i want

160
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,880
 to share a folder the documents folder between these two machines and we should see that the Mac

161
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,680
 links the windows machine as well because we made a bunch of an introducer so coming back into

162
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:34,160
 the Ubuntu machine come to the pairing with the Mac machine choose edit come to sharing and then

163
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,880
 share documents now i want to just show you one thing very interesting here the Ubuntu machine is

164
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,040
 able to expose the documents folder to the Mac because that's the folders it knows about if i

165
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,040
 come to the Mac and do the same thing come into the Ubuntu machine come to edit come to sharing

166
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,560
 you'll see it's able to expose its folders so it can get quite messy when you're trying to pair

167
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,080
 up all these folders especially if you've got some machines that only see some folders and some

168
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,880
 machines that say another but this is the power of something like you get complete control over

169
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,520
 what files go where what folders go where and what devices appeared but just something to be aware

170
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,880
 of coming back to Ubuntu let's allow the Mac to see documents press save

171
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,880
 so that's now up to date and if i come over to the Mac you'll see it's now got the documents

172
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,080
 folder because we auto accepted the documents folder so we didn't have to accept it and you'll see

173
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:29,120
 it's got windows down here now is disconnected so we've been introduced to the windows machine but it's

174
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,160
 not an auto pairing we still have to accept the pair on the windows machine this is just a part of

175
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:40,400
 the nature of how the n2n encryption works you are required to validate on both ends of the tunnel

176
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,160
 so come here with the windows machine you'll see it's popped up here new device do you want to allow

177
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,960
 so let's add device press save once we accept the pairing between the windows machine and the

178
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,960
 Mac machine windows is asked to do you want to share your documents folder with the Mac as well

179
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,440
 and this might seem a little bit counterintuitive at first because we've already shared documents

180
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,680
 with the Mac but we've only shared it from the Ubuntu machine because this is paired to paired not

181
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,400
 only do you have to accept each pairing relationship at the machine level you also have to accept it

182
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:11,280
 at the at the directory at the folder level as well so let's press share so now I've got this folder

183
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:17,600
 called documents I come into edit you can see that it's shared from this windows machine with these two

184
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,680
 machines so that's basically everything you need to know about pairing machines and sharing

185
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,760
 files on a local network before we turn our attention to dealing with machines that are remote

186
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,600
 towards and also deal with what happens when you leave your house and you're not on the same network

187
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,480
 let's just talk about two interesting configuration options one is how to ignore certain files for

188
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,040
 sharing and there is how to version files so we come back to the control panel just saying windows

189
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,800
 here come to documents and come into edit the first thing that I think it's interesting is file

190
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,040
 versioning so by default there's no file versioning whatsoever which means if you override a file

191
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,560
 then it's over in everywhere you can enable trash can file versioning which basically says keep file

192
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,520
 keep one copy the previous copy of a file in the trash can for as many days as you want and it's

193
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:03,040
 zero means forever that's the default by default all versions go into this ST versions directory

194
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,080
 but you can change that with the version path if you want you can also choose simple file versioning

195
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,640
 which is kind of the same as trash can versioning but you can have a fixed number of versions so

196
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,600
 I think the default is five and you can set as many as you want you can also choose staggered file

197
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,520
 versioning this is a little bit more complicated and you can see the text here that basically says for

198
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:26,480
 the first hour a version is kept every 30 seconds for the first day a version is kept every hour

199
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,280
 and for the first 30 days a version is kept every day I use this for most of my folders it gives you

200
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,680
 a good compromise between the accuracy of your versions but also not taking up to this space

201
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,080
 if your data is not that important you don't have to version it at all but my data is important so

202
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:45,200
 I typically version everything the other option for versioning is external file versioning where you

203
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:50,480
 can basically build your own command for handling the versioning I've never used this I think

204
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,320
 stack of file versioning is fine but just know that you can enable this versioning the other option

205
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,640
 is to ignore certain files and this is really really handy because often you get a load of junk files

206
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,800
 like temporary files in your folders and you don't want them to be synced around and you can do that

207
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,920
 here by creating these little patterns so one thing I like to do is I often call my files like

208
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,800
 .10 if I'm working on something temporarily so I'll add a star star that means any directory in the

209
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:18,640
 path any sub directory at all then a slash then another star .10 so anywhere in this directory where

210
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,360
 you see a file with a .10 extension just ignore it from syncing completely so one thing to bury

211
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,360
 in mind about both versioning and the ignore patterns is they are specific to the machine that you

212
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,360
 set them on so they're not like a global property so if you want to also ignore say here on the

213
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:38,080
 Ubuntu the same thing I have to come in and do the same pattern .tmp and I'll press save and now

214
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,080
 if I'd contest this from here so if I open up my terminal I'm in my documents folder already if we

215
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:52,240
 do echo hello to test .tmp and come over to the control panel and open up documents what you'll

216
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,320
 see is that there's still only one file and it says it's been reduced by the ignore patterns so this

217
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,240
 is a really nice way of making sure you're not just propagating too much data and also that you're

218
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,480
 not losing the data because you've able to version the files there are other advanced settings but

219
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,640
 these are the two most important ones that I find myself using I like I say do have versioning on

220
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,120
 pretty much every folder and I do have an extensive set of ignore patterns because you just get so much

221
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,920
 trash in your folders if you use them on a regular basis let's now look at how we deal with machines

222
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,640
 that are not on the local network how would I pair my sync thing with a machine that's in the cloud

223
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,960
 for example so I've already installed sync thing on a fedora machine running in linode cloud and I

224
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,200
 now want to bring it into my network now of course we can't access the GUI because the GUI is not

225
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,600
 accessible from external machines I could if I wanted to change that but I don't want to but I

226
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,240
 want to do instead is make an ssh tunnel from my local machine to the machine in the cloud and

227
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,840
 that way I can access the admin console or completely secure encrypted channel so to do that

228
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,120
 I'm going to come in and I'm going to ssh into the machine this is the IP address of my

229
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,760
 linode machine and then I'm going to add a dash L I'm going to create a tunnel I want the port

230
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,680
 on the Mac that I'm on the local machine to be 1 8384 you can try using 8384 but this max

231
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:05,040
 already running sync thing so it would clash so 1 8384 I want that to access local host on the

232
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:10,720
 machine I'm accessing so here local host doesn't mean the Mac it means this machine the one in linode

233
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,520
 and I wanted to go to 8384 on that machine and I should make sure I get that actually right

234
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,200
 okay cool so now we can do that and I'm connected to linode if I come over to my browser this is my

235
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:29,280
 local set up so it's Rob's MacBook Pro but I can also now access local host 1 8384 to access the

236
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,080
 linode setup now if I come to add remote device on here it's not going to find any devices because

237
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,480
 it's not on a network with any other sync thing machines I want to add one of my machines I'll just

238
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,960
 add my Mac in this case and I need to get the full device ID let's come over to the Mac

239
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,880
 let's click on identification I'm going to copy the full ID now I'm not going to blank these IDs

240
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,320
 out because they're not really sensitive because you need to obviously accept the pair on both sides

241
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,680
 you can keep yours private if you want the sync thing documentation is quite clear you don't

242
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,920
 need to worry about that too much so these will not be blanked out in the video coming over to the

243
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:08,160
 linode setup I'm going to paste the device ID in here we'll call that MVP, VP, press save

244
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:21,120
 if I click on it it's going to say disconnected unused and if I come over to the Mac close that down

245
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,880
 there we go it's popped up do you want to add the linode device press add now if I want to share

246
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,120
 one of these these directories with something in the cloud I might want to also encrypt it because

247
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,120
 that machine might be sensitive so you can add an extra layer of encryption here so let's say for

248
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,320
 example I want to share this documents folder I could choose a password here for and that way when

249
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,560
 you go to that machine you have to use this password to decrypt it I'm not going to bother for now

250
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:52,240
 I'm just going to leave that unencrypted I don't really use that very often so I will share that

251
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,080
 directory nonetheless press save come over to the linode do I want to share the documents folder

252
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:04,800
 yes I do press add press save and come in here and we can see it's up to date so it's only got one

253
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:10,480
 file and remember that my extra file over the Ubuntu side is being ignored so none of these

254
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,240
 machines are seeing that temporary file so that's the nice thing about the ignore patterns and I

255
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,520
 can just quickly come back into the shell here and see what folder I've got going to documents

256
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,320
 and there we see the test.txt file that we created before so at this point you could basically stop

257
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,760
 you've got a working sync thing installation you've got some folders shared you've got some

258
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,320
 machines paired you're able to access machines that are remote and if you take your laptop out of

259
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,000
 the house it's just acting like that machine that we've got a linode it's able to connect back

260
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,800
 to your house and you might be wondering how is that working these machines appear to appear how

261
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:46,480
 is the machine in the cloud accessing the machine in the house and this is what I talked about

262
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,720
 earlier on right at the start of the video this idea of a relay sync thing has a set of public

263
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,600
 relays and when two machines can't connect to each other they can use a relay as a as a middle

264
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,840
 middle point the data is still end to end encrypted but they both talk via the relay relays are

265
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,480
 very convenient because they just work out the box they are quite a bit slower and you have to

266
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,280
 decide how comfortable you are with the slight tradeoff of people not seeing your data but they

267
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,000
 are seeing your metadata they're seeing your IP addresses and they're seeing the pairing of

268
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,960
 the the IP addresses to the IDs and also which machines are talking to each other I don't use the

269
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,160
 relays instead I open up ports on my firewall to enable machines to talk to each other so let's see

270
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,600
 how to do that the first thing we need to do to make our Mac and the remote machine talk without

271
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,560
 using a relay is change the listen addresses for our Mac these are the addresses it will actually

272
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,640
 receive sync traffic on but these are also the addresses it publishes to the world and right now

273
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,200
 it's publishing that's going to use a relay so let's come into actions come to settings come to

274
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,320
 connection to here and where it says default under sync protocol listen address changes to TCP

275
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:55,920
 colom slash slash colom 22001 now I've chosen this this is the port number 22001 I've chosen this

276
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,800
 for a very specific reason if you've got multiple machines in your network that you want external

277
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:05,680
 traffic to hit you have to give them all a different port number because that port number then has

278
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:11,360
 to be exposed on your router the default port is 2200 and if you only have one device that's living

279
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,600
 in your house that you want external devices to access you can leave it as a default port that's

280
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,920
 fine when you have multiple devices inside your house that you want external devices to access you

281
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,840
 need to give them all a unique port because that unique port has before you're on your router so we're

282
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,160
 going to use 22001 for this machine and for every other machine I do this for I would give it a

283
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:35,120
 different port number so that's absolutely fine press save well I'm in these settings I also like

284
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,920
 to disable relaying so I'm going to uncheck enable relay here and press save so if I come back over

285
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,320
 to Leno now and look at the state of the MacBook Pro connection you can see it says disconnected if

286
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,960
 you expand it you'll see that all the addresses report no network activity and the reason for this is

287
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,440
 although we've changed the list and address on the MacBook we haven't yet opened up a port on our

288
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,840
 router to let that traffic come through that's the final step you have to do to make this work

289
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,040
 how you do this is going to be very specific to your router model I will show you how I do it in my

290
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,520
 unify set up so you get an idea of what has to be done but the actual UE will be different for you

291
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,720
 so I'm going to come into my unifying and I'm going to come to the add new port forwarding rule I'm

292
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:21,040
 just going to call this ST MVP and I want to forward 22001 which is the port that is specified

293
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:29,280
 before and the IP address I want to 42 is 1921681 125 that's the IP address of this MacBook

294
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:36,240
 I'm going to forward it again to 22001 like that click apply changes and then very quickly you see

295
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,720
 that the linoid is able to connect so it's now able to punch through the firewall through that

296
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,600
 that port forward and connect to my MacBook but not using a relay so let's now just talk very

297
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,520
 briefly about topology the kind of the layout of the syncing network you can create with your

298
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,080
 machines using sync thing as you've seen every device has to be paired with every other device

299
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,880
 if you want them all to share peer-to-peer and every folder has to be shared explicitly between

300
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:05,600
 every device in that network and that can get owners quite quickly also if you want to expose

301
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,200
 every device in your house to the external world and you don't want to use a relay that every

302
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,440
 device has to be given a unique port that port has to be forwarding on your firewall that can be

303
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,480
 quite a lot of admin to do what I've opted to do instead is to designate one machine in this case

304
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:24,720
 my NAS as my central hub I pair every machine with the NAS but not with each other this gives me a

305
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,720
 much simpler setup it means that every machine only has to pair with the NAS and only has to

306
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,960
 share folders with the NAS but it also means that only the NAS is exposed on the file I don't have

307
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,200
 to expose every single device in the machine that I use so you do lose a little bit of reliability

308
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,920
 with this setup obviously if the NAS goes down then the machines are not syncing with each other

309
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:48,000
 but you can just lazily add any peer relationships you want during that time of the outage on your NAS

310
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,520
 this is a really nice thing about sync thing the topology is so fluid that you can have full

311
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,720
 hub and spoke full peer-to-peer a hybrid you can move between them as you need to you never fixed

312
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,760
 in one shape and just to make things even easier most NAS software does have a sync thing package

313
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,920
 so I'm currently using a Synology NAS there's a sync thing package for that I know that QNAP

314
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:12,560
 have a sync thing package I'm moving and building a new NAS on top of true NAS you can run

315
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,720
 sync thing on that so pretty much sync thing is everywhere but that brings me back to the important

316
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,840
 topic of what to do about iOS and it's very frustrating that there is no sync thing on iOS and if

317
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,640
 you look on the app store you will see there is a third party app called Mobius Sync which I have

318
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,920
 and I've tried it out it does look like development on that has stopped so I don't recommend buying it

319
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:37,360
 there are thankfully two to me at least reasonable workarounds so I think the simplest way to get

320
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,160
 iOS and sync thing working together is to use iCloud as kind of like a bridge what I mean by this is

321
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:47,680
 you set up sync thing to sync your iCloud drive and let me show you how I've done that so in my

322
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,840
 folders here I've got this iCloud and the only thing you need to know is the special path where the

323
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,040
 iCloud drive kind of is shown in your file system so if I just open up this in edit you can see

324
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:03,680
 that it's in under my home directory it's in library, mobile documents, com, apple, cloud docs

325
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,160
 and you can just treat this like any other folder inside of sync thing I've tested this for many

326
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:13,120
 many weeks and it works just fine but you still have to run iCloud and I really don't want to have

327
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:18,640
 to run iCloud at all so the second solution but what I'm only just testing is whether or not

328
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,800
 next cloud can be used as a front end on top of the sync thing files and what I mean by this is

329
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:29,360
 I've installed next cloud on my NAS it's got access to all the folders that are synced to the

330
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,720
 NAS over sync thing and because the iPhone and the iPad have a really nice next cloud client

331
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,080
 they too can access those files it's not a perfect solution and I still am ironing out some

332
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:46,160
 kinks but I do think it will be the best solution until hopefully sync thing is natively supported

333
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,800
 on iOS so there we go that's everything that I think you need to know to get up and running with a

334
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:57,200
 proper sync thing installation how to pair machines how to share folders how to set up remote access

335
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:03,920
 how to pair with remote machines how to even interface with things like iCloud this reflects my set

336
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:09,920
 up that I've been using every day for the last well over a year and I've had no issues with it

337
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:15,440
 I do wish there was a smoother integration with iOS and an iPad but I can work around that with the

338
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,040
 iCloud sync I can work around that with the next cloud sync and hopefully in the future we'll see

339
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:23,600
 you native sync thing on iOS I hope you found this video useful I hope you found it entertaining
